In 2004-2009 I studied at the Francisk Skaryna Gomel State University with a degree in economics in the foreign market.

In 2009-2021 I worked in the field of taxation, accounting and consulting. For twelve years I have worked, studied, improved in a fairly strict field of activity, now I would like to master a profession that is new to me, more creative and interesting. I think this is the main goal that directed me to attend this school.

I can highlight my following strengths: communication skills, self-organization, punctuality, ability to work in a team.
I am a supporter of a healthy lifestyle, and my hobbies include: playing sports, reading, expanding my horizons and learning new things.
